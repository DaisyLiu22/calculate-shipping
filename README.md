This is a app that I wrote for my small business in South Korea.

There is only one product I sell, which weight about 0.8kg.

Each courier has different shipping fee rate. Here, I referred to the rate at Korean Post Office:

I've adjusted the price a little bit based on my past experience. 

To access the app, please go to: https://korean-domestic-shipping.herokuapp.com/shipping_fee/

It has been put into practice already:
